# What is Freetle ?

Freetle is a Open sourced toolbox to write high performance Data transformations.
It can be used as an ETL, using specifically developed connectors.
(For instance database connectors)
Freetle is written in the [Scala language](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and compiles to Java bytecode.

# Current status

Freetle is still very beta.
A lot polishing is to be done before it gets production-ready but the main features are here.
We expect a lot of improval in the near future.

# What does Freetle mean ?

Freetle is a contraction of Free ETL. An [ETL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) for Extract Transform and Load is a software tool used to transfer/transform datas (usually large chunks of it) from one system and one form to another system and another form.
